## üé® Graph Insights

### Network Analysis

#### Centrality
- **Alex**: Central hub with 21 connections
- **Sam**: Secondary node with 1 action (organizing birthday)
- **Other people**: Terminal nodes (family, friends, acquaintances)

#### Connectivity Patterns
```
Alex ‚Üí Events ‚Üí Other People
Alex ‚Üí Locations ‚Üí Activities
Alex ‚Üí Relationships ‚Üí Social Network
```

### Temporal Dimension
The graph captures a **5-year timeline**:
- **2020**: Sister's wedding
- **University years**: Professor Smith relationship, graduation
- **2025**: 28th birthday (current)
- **Ongoing**: Volunteer work, caf√© visits, hiking

### Social Network Structure
```
Family Layer:    Sister, Brother-in-law, Parents
Friend Layer:    Sam (best friend), Mike (roommate), College friends  
Community Layer: Barista Maria, Jane (shelter coordinator)
Academic Layer:  Professor Smith
```

## üß™ Entity Disambiguation Examples

### Successful Normalization
The Build phase successfully maintained consistency:

- **"Alex"** ‚Üí **"alex:PERSON"** (consistent lowercase)
- **"Columbia University"** ‚Üí **"columbia university:LOCATION"** 
- **"28th Birthday"** ‚Üí **"28th birthday:EVENT"**

### Relationship Consolidation
Multiple references to the same relationships were properly unified:
- Various mentions of Sam consolidated into single relationship
- Different event references (graduation, ceremony) properly categorized

## üìä Quality Assessment

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **High Accuracy**: All extracted relationships are factually correct
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Captures personal, professional, and social dimensions
3. **Temporal Awareness**: Events properly contextualized in time
4. **Entity Consistency**: No duplicate entities with different names
5. **Source Traceability**: Each triplet linked to original image description

### Areas for Enhancement üîß

1. **Emotional Context**: Emotions mentioned in source but not fully captured in triplets
2. **Hierarchical Relationships**: Could better represent family vs. friend vs. professional networks
3. **Event Details**: Some event specifics (locations, dates) could be more detailed
4. **Causal Relationships**: Could capture cause-effect relationships between events

---

## üîÑ Comparison: Before vs. After

### Input (Unstructured)
```
"Alex graduated from Columbia University in New York City. Professor Smith handed 
him his graduation diploma during the ceremony. Alex wore his cap and gown with pride, 
and his parents were there to witness this moment of great accomplishment."
```

### Output (Structured Knowledge)
```python
[
  ("alex:PERSON", "graduated from", "columbia university:LOCATION"),
  ("alex:PERSON", "key relationship", "professor smith:PERSON"),
  ("alex:PERSON", "key relationship", "parents:PERSON"),
  ("alex:PERSON", "attended", "graduation:EVENT"),
  ("alex:PERSON", "memorable event", "university graduation:EVENT")
]
```

### Value Added
1. **Queryable Structure**: Can now ask "Where did Alex graduate?" ‚Üí Columbia University
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Can trace Alex's academic connections
3. **Event Timeline**: Can place graduation in context of other life events
4. **Network Analysis**: Can analyze Alex's social/professional network
